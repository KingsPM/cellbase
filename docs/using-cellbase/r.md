**Note: R client library available from version 4 onwards** 

R library package is implemented and maintained for the latest R release and distributed through Bioconductor \([https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/cellbaseR.html](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/cellbaseR.html)\). For a quick install, please enter the R terminal and type:

```text

biocLite("cellbaseR")
```

The R code is also distributed together with the rest of the CellBase code. R code can be found at: `cellbase/clients/R`

The R code provides a library for programmatic access to CellBase data. No CLI is implemented in R.

Comprehensive description of the library is provided by the Bioconductor documentation:
