#### People and thanks

CellBase \(and the rest of OpenCB\) project was started by **Ignacio Medina** in **Dr. Joaquin Dopazo's** group at CIPF \(see below\). The first developers from Dopazo's group to be actively involved were Ignacio Medina \(currently he is the Head of a Computational Biology Lab at HPC Service at University of Cambridge, UK.\), Marta Bleda and Francisco Salavert. Today, Cellbase project is carried out by a collaboration among Ignacio Medina \(University of Cambridge\), Joaquin Dopazo \(CIPF\) and Justin Paschall \(EMBL-EBI\). Current active developers and contributors are: _Ignacio Medina \(im411@cam.ac.uk\): Founder and Project Leader, Bioinformatician. Software Architect & Project Manager._ F. Javier Lopez \(javier.lopez@genomicsengland.co.uk\): Software Engineer and Bioinformatician _Pablo Arce \(pablo.arce@bioinfomgp.org\): Software Engineer and Bioinformatician_ Marta Bleda \(mb2033@cam.ac.uk\): Computational Biologist \* Antonio Rueda \(antonio.rueda-martin@genomicsengland.co.uk\): Computational Biologist

CellBase team would like to thanks the following contributors for their support and contibution during these years, they are sorted chronologically.

**Computational Genomics \(CIPF\)**

[**Computational Genomics**](http://bioinfo.cipf.es/) department at CIPF is led by **Dr. Joaquin Dopazo**. He has been a crucial contributor to all OpenCB projects including CellBase since the beginning \(about 2011-2013\). Today he and his team are still playing an important role in both providing ideas and feature development.

**EBI Variation \(EMBL-EBI\)**

[**EBI Variation**](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/people/justin-paschall) team is led by **Dr. Justin Paschall**. Since 2014 he has been contributing CellBase and other OpenCB projects. His ideas and contrbutions have been very important. He is also actively involved in developing the Variant Annotation of CellBase. One developer deserves a special mention for his outstanding job done: \*F. Javier Lopez\*\* \(javier.lopez@genomicsengland.co.uk\): Software Engineer and Bioinformatician
