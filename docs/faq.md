# General

* What data is available in CellBase?

* How can I search for data?

* What's a "client"? What's the difference between "clients", the RESTful API, and the command line? Which one should I use?

* Do I need to specify which database to search? Do I need my own database?

* I want a list of variants associated with my gene of interest. How can I do that?

* How can I visualise the data? Can I use any visual tool?

Yes, you can use Genome Maps to browse variants.

* None of these questions helped me. Help!


# PyCellbase

How can I use PyCellbase? How can I install?


Does pycellbase work on Python 2?

PyCellBase requires Python 3.x, although most of the code is fully compatible with Python 2.7.



I'm getting an error message. What do I do?
